    <p className="card-text-review">Sam has now represented my on three deals in the Reno area as well as assisted me in finding an agent via his referral network for an
       out-of-state deal. He has a can-do attitude and is extremely detail oriented when executing complex transactions. This was critical in keeping closings to the 
       anticipated timelines and resolving issues as they arose. Aside from his real estate knowledge, Sam was able to assist with a great network of movers, contractors, 
       painters which supported pre-closing repairs and owner improvements after the sale. I give Sam my highest recommendation as my go-to person to represent me in the future. 
       He will be a great partner to anyone he works with.</p>

    <p className="card-text-review">Sam was an amazing help when our family was searching 
    for a home in the Reno area. We worked with Sam for almost a year until we found the 
    perfect house in our price range. We are not from the Reno area so Sam took a lot of 
    time to make sure the house was in a great location, close to stores, easy 
    to get to and from downtown and most importantly being a safe and clean location. 
    Sam spent countless hours, including his own personal time, meeting with us at multiple
    houses and never let us down and he never gave up on us or our search. With us not being from
    the area, we are not familiar many people or companies we can trust to do needed work and repairs, 
    but Sam had a professional contact for everything we needed. Sam is very friendly, honest and 
    professional and I will highly recommend him to my friends 
    and family when looking for a home in the Reno area. Thank you Sam!! You're the best!!</p>
